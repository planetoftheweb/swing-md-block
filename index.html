# 30 SECONDS OF KNOWLEDGE
 
I'm a sucker for replacement content extensions when you open a new tab, so I was excited to try this one which adds
random code snippets that can help you learn the language of your choice. It's very customizable with over 900 snippets.

I added this to my chrome based browserâ€¦I love to use Brave and turned off some of the less desirable languages like C++
and Ruby (who needs them).

## windi.config.js

```javascript
export default {
  theme: {
    /* ... */
  },
shortcuts: {
  'btn': 'py-2 px-4 font-semibold rounded-lg shadow-md',
  'btn-green': 'text-white bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-700',
  },
}
```
